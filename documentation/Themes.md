# Themes Module Documentation

## Overview

The Themes module allows vendors to customize the appearance of their online store. This provides flexibility for vendors to align their storefront with their brand identity without needing extensive technical knowledge. The platform will offer a selection of pre-built themes, and potentially options for minor customizations within those themes.

## Features

*   **Theme Selection:** Vendors can browse and choose from a gallery of available themes.
*   **Theme Preview:** Vendors can preview how a theme will look with their store's content before applying it.
*   **Basic Customization:** Options for customizing elements like primary color, fonts, and logo within the selected theme.
*   **Theme Activation:** Vendors can easily apply the chosen theme to their live store.
*   **Fallback Theme:** A default theme will be applied if no theme is explicitly selected by the vendor.

## Implementation Details

The themes will likely be structured as a set of view files and assets (CSS, JavaScript) that can be swapped out based on the vendor's selection. Multi-tenancy will need to be considered to ensure that themes are applied correctly to the individual tenant's storefront. Customization options might be stored in the tenant's database and used to dynamically adjust the styling of the selected theme. We will need a mechanism for managing theme assets and ensuring they are served efficiently for each tenant. The implementation should also consider how to handle future updates or additions to the theme library.

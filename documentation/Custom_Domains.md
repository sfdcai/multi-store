# Custom Domains Module Documentation

## Overview

The Custom Domains module allows vendors to map their own domain name to their online store hosted on the SaaS platform. This provides a professional and branded experience for their customers, making their store appear as a standalone website rather than a subdomain of the main platform.

## Features

- **Domain Mapping Interface:** A user-friendly interface within the Tenant Admin Panel for vendors to add and manage their custom domains.
- **DNS Verification:** Tools and instructions for vendors to verify domain ownership through DNS records (e.g., CNAME, A records).
- **SSL Certificate Provisioning:** Automatic or guided setup of SSL certificates for the custom domain to ensure secure connections (HTTPS).
- **Domain Status Tracking:** Displaying the current status of the custom domain (e.g., verifying, active, inactive).
- **Error Handling:** Providing clear feedback and troubleshooting guidance if domain mapping fails.

## Implementation Details

The implementation of the Custom Domains module will involve configuring the web server (e.g., Nginx) to handle incoming requests for vendor-specific domains and route them to the correct tenant's application instance. This will likely involve dynamic configuration based on the domain provided in the request header. The DNS verification process will require generating unique verification codes for each vendor and providing instructions on how to add them to their domain's DNS records. SSL certificate provisioning can be integrated with services like Let's Encrypt for automated certificate issuance and renewal. The application logic will need to store and manage the mapping between vendor tenants and their custom domains, as well as track the status of the domain configuration. This will involve database schemas to store domain information and associated tenant IDs.

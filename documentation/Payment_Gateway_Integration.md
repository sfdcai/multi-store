# Payment Gateway Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the process and considerations for integrating various payment gateways into the SaaS Grocery Platform. Each vendor on the platform will have the ability to connect their own payment gateway account to accept payments directly from their customers.

## Supported Gateways

This section will list the payment gateways that are officially supported and integrated with the platform. Initially, this may include a primary gateway like Stripe, with plans to add others such as Razorpay, PayPal, etc., based on demand and feasibility.

## Integration Steps

This section details the technical steps required to integrate a new payment gateway. This includes:
- Setting up API credentials for the vendor's account with the payment gateway.
- Implementing the necessary backend logic to create charges, process refunds, and handle transactions through the gateway's API.
- Integrating the payment forms or checkout flows on the customer storefront to interact with the chosen gateway.

## Handling Webhooks/Notifications

This section describes how the platform will handle webhooks and notifications from payment gateways. This is crucial for receiving real-time updates on transaction statuses (success, failure, refunds, disputes) and ensuring data consistency between the payment gateway and the platform's database.

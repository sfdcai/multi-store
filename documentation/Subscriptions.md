# Subscriptions Module Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the functionality and implementation details of the Subscriptions module within the SaaS Grocery Platform. This module handles the platform-level subscriptions for vendors, allowing them to subscribe to different plans to use the platform's services.

## Features

*   **Subscription Plan Management:** Defines different subscription tiers (e.g., Free, Basic, Pro) with varying features and pricing.
*   **Vendor Subscription Management:** Allows vendors to subscribe to, upgrade, or downgrade their subscription plans.
*   **Billing Integration:** Integrates with a payment gateway (like Stripe Cashier) for handling recurring billing and payments.
*   **Trial Periods:** Support for offering trial periods to new vendors.
*   **Subscription Status Tracking:** Tracks the status of vendor subscriptions (active, trial, canceled, past due).
*   **Invoice Generation:** Automatic generation of invoices for subscription payments.

## Implementation Details

The Subscriptions module will leverage Laravel Cashier (Stripe) for managing vendor subscriptions and billing. This will involve setting up Stripe products and plans that correspond to our platform's subscription tiers.

Key implementation aspects will include:

*   **Database Design:** Migrations and models for `subscriptions` and related tables to store subscription information.
*   **Stripe Webhooks:** Setting up webhooks to handle events from Stripe (e.g., successful payment, subscription renewal, failed payment).
*   **User Interface:** Creating pages in the Super Admin panel to manage subscription plans and in the Vendor Admin panel for vendors to manage their subscriptions.
*   **Integration with other Modules:** Ensuring that features in other modules (like Tenant Admin Panel) are enabled or disabled based on the vendor's current subscription plan.
*   **Error Handling:** Implementing robust error handling for payment failures and subscription issues.

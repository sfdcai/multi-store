# Themes Module Documentation

## Overview

The Themes module allows vendors to customize the appearance of their online store. This provides flexibility for vendors to align their storefront with their brand identity without needing extensive technical knowledge. The platform will offer a selection of pre-built themes, and potentially options for minor customizations within those themes.

## Features

*   **Theme Selection:** Vendors can browse and choose from a gallery of available themes.
*   **Pre-built Theme Library:** Provides a diverse collection of professionally designed themes for vendors to select from.
*   **Theme Preview:** Vendors can preview how a theme will look with their store's content before applying it.
*   **Theme Application:** Allows vendors to easily apply the chosen theme to their live store.
*   **Basic Customization Options:** Provides options for customizing elements like primary color schemes, fonts, button styles, and uploading a custom logo within the selected theme, without requiring code modifications.
*   **Theme Activation:** Vendors can easily apply the chosen theme to their live store.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensures all provided themes are fully responsive and provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
*   **Theme Updates and Compatibility:** Mechanisms to handle updates to existing themes and ensure compatibility with platform changes.
*   **Fallback Theme:** A default theme will be applied if no theme is explicitly selected by the vendor.

## Implementation Details

The themes will likely be structured as a set of view files and assets (CSS, JavaScript) that can be swapped out based on the vendor's selection. Multi-tenancy will need to be considered to ensure that themes are applied correctly to the individual tenant's storefront. Customization options might be stored in the tenant's database and used to dynamically adjust the styling of the selected theme. We will need a mechanism for managing theme assets and ensuring they are served efficiently for each tenant. The implementation should also consider how to handle future updates or additions to the theme library.
*   **Theme File Structure:** Define a clear and organized file structure for themes, separating views, assets (CSS, JS, images), and configuration files.
*   **Storing Theme Preference:** Store the selected theme and any customization settings for each tenant in their respective tenant database or in a dedicated settings table.
*   **Loading Theme Files:** Implement a mechanism (e.g., using Laravel's view finders or a custom service provider) to dynamically load the correct theme's view files and assets based on the active tenant.
*   **Overriding Default Files:** Allow theme files to override the default platform views and assets, providing theme-specific styling and layout.
*   **Handling Theme Updates with Customizations:** Devise a strategy to handle updates to base themes while preserving vendor-specific customization settings. This might involve applying customizations as an additional layer on top of the updated theme.
*   **Implementing a Customization System:** Build a system within the Tenant Admin Panel that allows vendors to configure the basic customization options (colors, fonts, logo) and stores these preferences.

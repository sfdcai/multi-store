# Analytics Module Documentation

## Overview

This module is responsible for providing vendors with basic insights into their store's performance. It collects and displays data related to orders, sales, product views, and other relevant metrics.

## Features

### Vendor Analytics Dashboard

Provides vendors with insights into their store's performance.

- **Key Metrics Display:** Showcases crucial numbers like total sales, number of orders, and average order value for a selected period.
- **Sales Trends:** Visualizes sales data over time (daily, weekly, monthly) through charts or graphs.
- **Top-Selling Products:** Lists products with the highest sales volume or revenue.
- **Product View Counts:** Displays how many times each product has been viewed.
- **Customer Demographics and Behavior:** (Optional) If collecting this data, provides insights into customer location, purchasing habits, etc.
- **Order Status Breakdown:** Shows the distribution of orders by status (e.g., pending, processing, completed, cancelled).

### Super Admin Analytics Dashboard

Provides the Super Admin with an overview of the entire platform's performance.

- **Platform-Wide Sales Summary:** Aggregated sales data across all tenants.
- **Tenant Performance Ranking:** Ranks tenants based on sales, order volume, or other key metrics.
- **New Tenant Signups:** Tracks the number of new vendors joining the platform over time.
- **Subscription Plan Breakdown:** Shows the distribution of vendors across different subscription plans.
- **Overall Platform Usage Statistics:** Provides insights into active tenants, total users, storage usage, etc.

### Reporting and Data Export

Allows users to extract analytics data for further analysis.

- Provides options to generate reports in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).
- Allows exporting raw or aggregated analytics data.

## Implementation Details

- **Data Source:** Utilize the data stored in the tenant-specific analytics columns and tables (`products`, `orders`, `product_views`) and the global analytics tables (`platform_sales_summary`, `tenant_performance_metrics`).
- **Data Querying and Aggregation:** Implement efficient database queries and aggregation logic to retrieve and process analytics data.
- **Data Visualization:** Use a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, ApexCharts) to create interactive and informative visualizations for the dashboards.
- **Scheduled Jobs:** Implement scheduled jobs or background processes to aggregate data from tenant databases and populate the global analytics tables periodically.
- **Access Control:** Ensure strict access control to prevent vendors from accessing data from other tenants and to provide the Super Admin with access to platform-wide data.
- **Data Privacy and Compliance:** Adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) when collecting, storing, and displaying customer and vendor data.

# Authentication and Authorization Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication and authorization mechanisms for the SaaS Grocery Platform. It details how users will prove their identity and how access to various platform resources and functionalities will be controlled based on their assigned roles.

## User Roles

The platform supports distinct user roles with varying levels of access and permissions:

*   **Super Admin:** Has full access to manage the entire platform, including user management, subscription plans, global settings, and overall platform analytics.
*   **Vendor Admin:** Manages a single tenant's (grocery store's) operations, including products, orders, customers within their store, store settings, and payment integrations for their store.
*   **Customer:** Can browse products on a vendor's storefront, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage their own profile and order history within a specific vendor's store.

## Authentication Methods

This section describes how users will authenticate themselves to the platform:

*   **Super Admin Authentication:** Likely a separate login flow for platform administrators, possibly using a dedicated admin panel URL and strong authentication methods.
*   **Vendor Admin Authentication:** Each vendor's store will have its own login area for their administrators. Authentication will be tenant-specific, likely using email/password or potentially social login options.
*   **Customer Authentication:** Customers will authenticate on individual vendor storefronts. This will involve standard registration and login processes, possibly including guest checkout options.
*   **Standard Login (Email/Password):** This will be the primary authentication method for Super Admins and Vendor Admins accessing their respective dashboards and administration areas.
*   **API Token Authentication:** Used for API access, enabling secure communication for features like the Vendor Admin panel's interaction with the backend or for future third-party integrations.
*   **Session-based Authentication:** The primary method for authenticating customers interacting with a specific vendor's storefront, maintaining their logged-in state during their browsing session.
*   **"Remember Me" Functionality:** To enhance user experience, the option to remain logged in across browser sessions will be available for all user roles.

## Authorization Mechanisms

This section details how access to resources and functionalities will be controlled based on user roles:

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Permissions will be assigned to roles, and users will inherit permissions based on their assigned role (Super Admin, Vendor Admin, Customer).
*   **Tenant-Specific Authorization:** Vendor Admins and Customers will only have access to data and functionalities related to their specific tenant (grocery store). This will be enforced at the application and potentially database level using the multi-tenancy solution.
*   **Permission Granularity:** Authorization will be granular, allowing for fine-grained control over what actions each role can perform within their authorized scope (e.g., a Vendor Admin can manage *their* products but not products in another vendor's store).
*   **Using Laravel Gates and Policies:** Leverage Laravel's built-in authorization features (Gates and Policies) to define and manage permissions and authorization logic in a structured and maintainable way.
*   **Middleware Protection:** Implement middleware on routes and controllers to protect endpoints and ensure that only authenticated and authorized users with the correct role and tenant context can access them.

# Payments Module Documentation

## Overview

The Payments module is responsible for handling all payment transactions within the SaaS platform. This includes both vendor subscriptions to the platform and customer payments for orders placed on individual vendor storefronts.

## Features

-   **Vendor Subscription Payments:** Manages recurring payments from vendors for their platform usage (handled via Stripe Cashier).
-   **Tenant-Specific Payment Gateways:** Allows each vendor to integrate their own payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay) for processing customer orders on their store.
-   **Secure Transaction Processing:** Ensures secure handling of sensitive payment information.
-   **Payment Confirmation and Notifications:** Provides confirmation to customers and vendors upon successful transactions.
-   **Refunds and Disputes:** (Future enhancement) Functionality to handle refunds and payment disputes.

## Implementation Details

This module will leverage the Laravel Cashier package for handling vendor subscriptions with Stripe. For tenant-specific customer payments, we will need to integrate with various payment gateway APIs. This will likely involve storing tenant API keys securely and dynamically configuring the payment processing based on the active tenant. Webhooks will be crucial for handling asynchronous events like payment confirmations and failures. Error handling and logging will be implemented to monitor transactions.

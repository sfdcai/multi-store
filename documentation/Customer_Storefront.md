# Customer Storefront Module Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the Customer Storefront module, which is the public-facing part of the SaaS grocery platform. This is where customers will browse products, add items to their cart, and complete the checkout process. Each storefront is branded and managed by an individual vendor.

## Features

The Customer Storefront module will include the following key features for customers browsing and shopping on a vendor's store:

*   **Product Browsing and Search:** Customers can easily browse through the vendor's product catalog, with options to filter by category and search for specific products by name or description.
*   **Product Details View:** Detailed information for each product, including multiple images, a comprehensive description, pricing, available variations (like size or color), and potentially customer reviews or ratings.
*   **Adding to Cart:** Customers can add desired products in specified quantities to their shopping cart directly from product listings or detail pages.
*   **Cart Management:** A dedicated shopping cart page or component where customers can review selected items, update quantities, and remove items before proceeding to checkout.
*   **Guest and Registered Checkout:** Customers have the option to proceed with checkout as a guest without creating an account, or they can register/log in to use saved information and track orders.
*   **Shipping Information Input:** During checkout, customers provide their shipping address details.
*   **Payment Method Selection:** Integration with the vendor's configured payment gateway allows customers to select from available payment methods and securely enter payment information.
*   **Order Confirmation:** Upon successful order placement, customers receive an order confirmation page and typically an email summarizing their purchase.
*   **Order History (for registered users):** Registered customers can access their account to view a history of their past orders and check the status of current orders.
*   **Responsive Design:** The storefront will be fully responsive and accessible on various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
*   **Vendor Branding:** The storefront will reflect the specific branding (logo, colors, potentially themes) of the vendor.

## Implementation Details

The Customer Storefront will primarily be built using Laravel's backend to handle routing and data retrieval. The frontend can utilize Blade templates with a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS for styling. For more dynamic features like the shopping cart, a JavaScript framework (such as Alpine.js or Livewire for a more tightly coupled Laravel approach, or a separate framework like Vue/React if preferred) can be used.

The application will need to:

*   **Using Laravel for Routing and Data:** Define routes for product listings, product details, cart, and checkout. Use Laravel's features to fetch and process data.
*   **Fetching Tenant Data:** Crucially, ensure that the application fetches data (products, settings, etc.) exclusively from the correct tenant's database based on the incoming request (e.g., subdomain or domain).
*   **Data Fetching:** Efficiently retrieving product and store information from the tenant-specific database.
*   **Frontend Technologies (Blade, JavaScript framework):** Utilize Blade for server-side rendering and a JavaScript framework for interactive elements like adding to cart without full page reloads and managing the cart state on the client side.
*   **Integration with Payments:** Communicate with the backend's Payments module to initiate and process payment transactions securely via the vendor's configured gateway during the checkout process.
*   **Shipping Cost Calculation:** Implement logic to calculate shipping costs based on the shipping settings defined by the vendor in the Tenant Admin Panel, typically based on destination address, order weight, or total amount.
*   **Guest Checkout Handling:** Implement a mechanism to handle guest users during checkout, potentially storing their cart and temporary customer information in the session or a temporary database table until the order is placed.
*   **State Management:** Managing the state of the shopping cart and user sessions on the frontend or in the backend session.
*   **Error Handling:** Implementing robust error handling for user interactions and API requests.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring fast loading times and a smooth user experience, especially for image loading and data rendering.
*   **SEO Considerations:** Implementing basic SEO practices to help vendor stores rank in search results.
*   **Theming/Customization:** If themes are implemented (as per the core modules), ensure the storefront can apply the vendor's chosen theme.

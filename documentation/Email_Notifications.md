# Email/Notifications Module Documentation

## Overview

This module handles all email and notification communications within the SaaS platform. This includes transactional emails for customers (order confirmations, shipping updates) and administrative notifications for vendors (new orders, low stock alerts) and the super admin (new vendor signups, system alerts).

## Features

- **Transactional Emails:** Sending automated emails for customer actions (e.g., order placed, order shipped, account created).
- **Vendor Notifications:** Alerting vendors about important events related to their store (e.g., new order received, product low in stock, payment successful).
- **Admin Notifications:** Notifying the super admin about platform-level events (e.g., new tenant registration, subscription status changes, system errors).
- **Configurable Templates:** Allowing customization of email content for different notification types.
- **Email Queueing:** Implementing a queue system to handle sending large volumes of emails efficiently without blocking the main application process.

## Implementation Details

The email and notification functionality will be built using Laravel's built-in mail and notification systems. We will define Mailable classes for different email types and Notification classes for various notification triggers. A queue driver (e.g., Redis or database) will be configured to handle sending emails asynchronously. Email templates will be created using Blade views, allowing for dynamic content and easy customization. Integration with a transactional email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) will be necessary for reliable email delivery. Notification preferences for vendors and customers may be implemented to allow users to control which notifications they receive.

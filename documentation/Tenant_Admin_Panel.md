# Tenant Admin Panel Module Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the Tenant Admin Panel module, which provides vendors with a dedicated dashboard to manage their online store. This panel allows vendors to control various aspects of their store, including products, orders, settings, and payment integrations.
It is the central hub for vendors to operate their grocery business on the platform.

## Features

-   **Dashboard Overview:** Provides a summary of key store metrics such as total sales, number of orders, and top-selling products (integration with Analytics module).
-   **Product Management:** Vendors can add, edit, delete, and view their products. Includes managing product details, pricing, descriptions, and images (CRUD operations).
-   **Category Management:** Allows vendors to create, edit, and manage product categories to organize their store.
-   **Inventory Tracking:** Provides functionality to track inventory levels for each product and potentially set up low stock notifications.
-   **Order Viewing and Processing:** Vendors can view a list of all customer orders, see order details, and update order statuses (e.g., Pending, Processing, Shipped, Completed, Cancelled).
-   **Store Settings:** Vendors can customize their store's name, logo, contact information, policies, and other general settings.
-   **Shipping Configuration:** Vendors can define shipping zones, methods, and rates.
-   **Payment Gateway Integration:** Vendors can connect and configure their preferred payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay).
-   **Customer Management:** Vendors can view and manage customer accounts related to their store.
-   **Reporting & Analytics:** Basic reporting on sales, orders, and product performance within their store.
-   **File/Image Uploads:** Functionality for vendors to upload product images, store logo, and other relevant files.

## Implementation Details

This section will detail the technical implementation of the Tenant Admin Panel. It will cover:

-   The specific routes and controllers used for each feature.
-   Handling of file uploads for product images and other assets.
-   **Database Interaction:** Utilizing Laravel's Eloquent ORM for interacting with the tenant-specific database tables (e.g., `products`, `orders`, `customers`, `settings`).
-   **Access Control:** Implementing robust access control mechanisms (e.g., Laravel Policies or Gates) to ensure that vendor admins can only access and manage data for their specific tenant.
-   **User Interface:** Building a user-friendly administrative interface. This could be done using Laravel Blade templates with a framework like Tailwind CSS for styling. For more interactive elements, Alpine.js or Livewire can be used, or a more complex SPA approach with Vue.js or React could be considered for the tenant admin panel itself.
-   **Integration with Payments Module:** Interfacing with the Payments module's services or classes to handle the configuration and management of vendor-specific payment gateways.
-   **Integration with Analytics Module:** Fetching and displaying relevant analytics data from the tenant-specific analytics tables (`product_views`, etc.) and potentially aggregated data for the vendor dashboard.
-   **Routing and Controllers:** Defining clear and organized routes and controllers to handle requests for each administrative function (e.g., `/admin/products`, `/admin/orders/{id}`).
-   **Form Handling and Validation:** Implementing robust form handling and validation for creating and updating records (products, settings, etc.).
-   **File Storage:** Utilizing Laravel's file storage capabilities (e.g., with the `storage` facade) to handle the uploading and storage of product images, logos, and other files, ensuring they are stored securely and associated with the correct tenant.
-   **Notifications:** Implementing system notifications for vendors (e.g., new order notifications, low stock alerts).
-   **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensuring that only authenticated and authorized vendor administrators can access the admin panel and its features. This will involve checking tenant ownership and user roles.

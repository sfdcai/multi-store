# Deployment Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for deploying and managing the SaaS Grocery Platform in a production environment. It covers the deployment environment setup, the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, and considerations for scaling the application.

## Deployment Environment

The production environment will be configured to ensure the application is performant, secure, and scalable.

- **Server Infrastructure:** The application can be deployed on Virtual Private Servers (VPS) from providers like DigitalOcean or AWS EC2, or managed platforms like Laravel Forge or Laravel Vapor. For larger-scale deployments and easier management, Kubernetes could be considered in the future.
- **Web Server:** Nginx will be used as the web server to handle incoming HTTP requests, route traffic to the application, and serve static assets.
- **Application Server:** The Laravel application will be run using PHP-FPM, which is recommended for serving PHP applications.
- **Database:** MySQL or MariaDB will be used as the primary database. The database setup should consider replication for high availability and performance, as well as regular backups.
- **Cache/Queue:** Redis will be used for caching frequently accessed data and managing background jobs through Laravel Queues.
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive configuration information, such as database credentials, API keys, and application settings, will be stored securely using environment variables.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Tools for monitoring application performance (e.g., New Relic, Datadog) and collecting/analyzing application logs (e.g., ELK stack, Sentry) should be implemented to identify and resolve issues quickly.

## CI/CD Pipeline

A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will be set up using GitHub Actions to automate the process of testing, building, and deploying the application.

- **Code Commit/Push:** The CI/CD workflow will be triggered automatically whenever code is committed or pushed to the main branch of the GitHub repository.
- **Static Analysis and Linting:** Code quality checks using tools like PHPStan, ESLint, and Style

# Payments Module Documentation

## Overview

The Payments module is responsible for handling all payment transactions within the SaaS platform. This includes both vendor subscriptions to the platform and customer payments for orders placed on individual vendor storefronts.

## Features

-   **Vendor Subscription Payments:** Manages recurring payments from vendors for their platform usage (handled via Stripe Cashier).
-   **Support for Multiple Payment Gateways:** Allows integration with various popular payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay, and potentially others in the future).
-   **Vendor Credential Configuration:** Provides an interface for vendors to securely configure their own API keys and credentials for their chosen payment gateway.
-   **Secure Payment Processing:** Ensures secure handling of sensitive payment information and compliance with relevant security standards.
-   **Support for Different Payment Methods:** Handles various payment methods offered by the integrated gateways (e.g., credit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers).
-   **Payment Status Management:** Tracks and updates the status of each payment transaction (e.g., pending, completed, failed, refunded, disputed).
-   **Refunds and Disputes:** Implements functionality to initiate refunds and manage payment disputes through the integrated gateway APIs.
-   **Vendor Payouts:** Facilitates the process of transferring funds from the platform or payment gateway to the vendor's bank account (details depend on integration method).
-   **Transaction Logging:** Logs detailed information for all payment transactions for auditing and debugging purposes.
-   **Payment Confirmation and Notifications:** Triggers notifications to customers and vendors upon successful transactions and other relevant payment events.

## Implementation Details

This module will leverage the Laravel Cashier package for handling vendor subscriptions with Stripe. For tenant-specific customer payments, we will need to integrate with various payment gateway APIs. This will likely involve storing tenant API keys securely and dynamically configuring the payment processing based on the active tenant. Webhooks will be crucial for handling asynchronous events like payment confirmations and failures. Error handling and logging will be implemented to monitor transactions.

-   **Gateway SDKs/Libraries:** Utilize official or well-maintained SDKs and libraries provided by each payment gateway for seamless integration.
-   **Secure Credential Storage:** Store sensitive vendor API keys and credentials securely, potentially using environment variables, encrypted database fields, or a dedicated secrets management system.
-   **Webhook Handling:** Implement robust webhook handlers to receive and process real-time updates from payment gateways regarding transaction status changes.
-   **Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms:** Implement comprehensive error handling and potential retry mechanisms for failed transactions and API calls.
-   **Integration with Order Module:** Seamlessly integrate with the Order module to update order statuses based on the outcome of payment transactions.
-   **Security and PCI Compliance:** Adhere to security best practices and consider the implications of PCI compliance when handling payment data.
-   **Dynamic Gateway Selection:** Implement logic to dynamically select and use the appropriate payment gateway based on the vendor's configuration for a given order.

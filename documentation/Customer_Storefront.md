# Customer Storefront Module Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the Customer Storefront module, which is the public-facing part of the SaaS grocery platform. This is where customers will browse products, add items to their cart, and complete the checkout process. Each storefront is branded and managed by an individual vendor.

## Features

The Customer Storefront module will include the following key features:

*   **Product Browsing:** Customers can view products listed by the vendor, with options for filtering and searching.
*   **Product Details:** Detailed views of individual products, including descriptions, images, pricing, and variations (if applicable).
*   **Shopping Cart:** A persistent shopping cart where customers can add, remove, and update product quantities.
*   **Checkout Process:** A streamlined checkout flow allowing customers to enter shipping information, select payment methods, and place orders.
*   **User Accounts (Optional):** Customers can create accounts to save shipping information, view order history, and track current orders.
*   **Responsive Design:** The storefront will be fully responsive and accessible on various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
*   **Vendor Branding:** The storefront will reflect the specific branding (logo, colors, potentially themes) of the vendor.

## Implementation Details

The Customer Storefront will be built using a frontend technology (likely Blade with Tailwind CSS, or potentially Vue/React as an option). It will interact with the backend API to fetch product data, manage the shopping cart, process orders, and handle user authentication (if implemented). Key considerations for implementation include:

*   **Data Fetching:** Efficiently retrieving product and store information from the tenant-specific database.
*   **State Management:** Managing the state of the shopping cart and user sessions on the frontend.
*   **Payment Integration:** Integrating with the vendor's chosen payment gateway for secure transaction processing.
*   **Error Handling:** Implementing robust error handling for user interactions and API requests.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring fast loading times and a smooth user experience, especially for image loading and data rendering.
*   **SEO Considerations:** Implementing basic SEO practices to help vendor stores rank in search results.
